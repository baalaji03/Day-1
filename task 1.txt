2.It works on the binary format protocol.
3.IT allows Multiplexing like if HTTP.2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so no resource blocks any other resource and it split the data into binary code message. 
4.It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages.
5.HTTP2 uses HPACK for data compression.
6.HTTP2 offers a feature called weighted prioritization. This allows developers to decide which page resources will load first, every time.
